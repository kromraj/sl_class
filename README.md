# Task: Supervised Learning - Classification

## Introduction
This project involves utilizing the penguins.csv dataset, which contains features for various penguin species. The primary objectives include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and training machine learning models for classification.

### Dataset
The dataset, penguins.csv, includes characteristics for different penguin species.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducting EDA involves exploring and analyzing the dataset to gain insights into its structure, patterns, and relationships.

### Machine Learning Models
Several classification models will be trained on the dataset:
- KNN (K Nearest Neighbours):
A model that classifies data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors.
- Decision Tree:
A model that makes decisions based on a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences.
- SVM (Support Vector Machines):
A model that finds a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies data points.
- Random Forest:
An ensemble model consisting of a collection of decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.
- Boosting (AdaBoost):
An ensemble technique that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.
- Ensembling:
Combining multiple classifiers for improved performance and robustness.
